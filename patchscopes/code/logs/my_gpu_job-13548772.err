/oscar/scratch/aparasel/bias-search/eval_bias.py:92: SettingWithCopyWarning: 
A value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame.
Try using .loc[row_indexer,col_indexer] = value instead

See the caveats in the documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#returning-a-view-versus-a-copy

The `seen_tokens` attribute is deprecated and will be removed in v4.41. Use the `cache_position` model input instead.
